/*For making tilemap levels, start with a new scene and have the tile package added( if selected 2d option, should be incuded already). Then, go to create, 2D object, Tilemap, and then whatever choice you desire.
after that is done, it will create a grid and a tilemap child, add the tilemap, tilemap renderer, and tilemap collider 2d. Those will render and be the hitboxes for the tiles. 
Once that is done, go to window, and find Tile Palette, and open it. There will be a tile palette for this project, but for future projects, add all the tile sprites that will be used in that tile palette window
Once that is done, you can use the tools to add the tiles from the palette into the level itself.*/
